      <h2>Skills</h2>
      <h3>Sketching</h3>
      <p>Whether pencil, pen, or dry-erase marker, I am comfortable and adept at visualizing my ideas through low-fidelity sketches or whiteboard drawings.</p>

      <h3>Prototyping</h3>
      <p>I have experience using web frameworks that make it easy to generate interactive prototypes for internal/client review. Lately I've been partial to Bootstrap and Middleman.</p>

      <h3>Design</h3>
      <p>I graduated in 2006 with a degree in Visual Arts (focused in Graphic Design) from SUNY New Paltz. There, I learned the history, theory, and application of Graphic Design. My tools of choice for UI design are Sketch and the browser.</p>

      <h3>Coding</h3>
      <p>My modern Front End Development workflow includes Sublime, Git, Sass/Less, NPM, Bower, and Gulp.</p>
